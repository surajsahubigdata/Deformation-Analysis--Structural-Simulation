# üöÄ Predicting Material Deformation with Machine Learning! üõ†Ô∏è

This project aims to predict material deformation based on physical properties and applied load parameters using a machine learning model. We leverage synthetic data generated from simulated physical relationships and deploy a predictive model in a simple web-based application using Streamlit.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict deformation (e.g., displacement, stress, or strain) in a material or structure under specified conditions. This predictive model can be valuable for engineers and researchers who need quick insights based on input parameters without running time-consuming simulations in software like ANSYS.

### Key Components
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: We simulate deformation data based on parameters such as load, material density, Young's modulus, and object dimensions.
- **Model Training**: A Random Forest regression model is trained on the synthetic dataset.
- **Streamlit App**: A web app for real-time predictions based on user inputs, hosted on a simple UI.
